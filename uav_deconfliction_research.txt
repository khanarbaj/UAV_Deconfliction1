# UAV Deconfliction Research

## Techniques for UAV Deconfliction

1. **Geofencing**: Define virtual boundaries in the airspace. UAVs are programmed to avoid or stay within these zones, reducing the risk of conflict.

2. **Trajectory Prediction and Conflict Detection**: Use algorithms to predict UAV paths and detect potential conflicts before they occur. Techniques include:
   - Kinematic models for path prediction
   - Time-to-conflict calculations
   - Probabilistic risk assessment

3. **Conflict Resolution Algorithms**:
   - Rule-based (e.g., right-of-way rules)
   - Optimization-based (e.g., linear programming to minimize deviation)
   - Heuristic and AI-based (e.g., genetic algorithms, reinforcement learning)

4. **Communication and Coordination**:
   - Centralized: A ground station or server coordinates all UAVs.
   - Decentralized: UAVs communicate peer-to-peer to negotiate maneuvers.

5. **Sense and Avoid (SAA)**:
   - Onboard sensors (e.g., radar, LiDAR, cameras) detect obstacles and other UAVs.
   - Real-time path adjustment to avoid collisions.

## Architecture for UAV Deconfliction Systems

1. **Layered Architecture**:
   - **Perception Layer**: Gathers data from sensors and external sources (e.g., ADS-B, radar).
   - **Decision Layer**: Runs conflict detection and resolution algorithms.
   - **Control Layer**: Issues commands to the UAVâ€™s flight controller.

2. **Centralized vs. Decentralized**:
   - Centralized systems offer global optimization but may have single points of failure.
   - Decentralized systems are more robust and scalable but require reliable communication protocols.

3. **Integration with UTM (UAS Traffic Management)**:
   - Interface with national or regional UTM systems for airspace management.
   - Use standard protocols (e.g., ASTM F3411) for interoperability.

## Best Practices

1. **Modular Design**: Separate components for sensing, decision-making, and control to allow for easier testing and upgrades.

2. **Simulation and Testing**: Use simulation environments (e.g., Gazebo, AirSim) to test deconfliction strategies before real-world deployment.

3. **Fail-Safe Mechanisms**: Implement emergency procedures (e.g., return-to-home, hover-in-place) in case of system failures or loss of communication.

4. **Compliance with Regulations**: Ensure the system adheres to local and international UAV operation standards (e.g., FAA, EASA).

5. **Logging and Monitoring**: Maintain logs of UAV positions, decisions, and conflicts for post-mission analysis and continuous improvement.

6. **Security**: Protect communication channels and data to prevent spoofing or unauthorized control.
